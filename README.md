If you've forked a copy of this repo or are playing around with the code on the `http://kortaggio.github.io/battleboat` page, please be nice and don't hack the `Stats` object. I'm using Google Analytics to collect info about the AI's win/loss percentage in order to improve the bot, so if you do look around, I kindly ask that you don't give it bad data. Thanks :)

If you want to try stuff out, run `setDebug(true);` in the console before doing anything. You'll also get access to some cool features.
